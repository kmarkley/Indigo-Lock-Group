## Fan Group

This plugin defines group devices for your fans:

* A speedcontrol (fan) device that both controls and reflects the state of other (physical) fans
* A simple relay device that toggles one speed
* A peculiar device that causes a group of fans to turn on if a thermostat's temperature is more than N degrees from setpoint when the hvac equipment is active.
